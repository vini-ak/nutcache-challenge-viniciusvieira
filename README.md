# Nutcache Employees' CRUD

This project was made for the Nutcache's selective process. It was build with **React** for the frontend side and **Node.js** on the server side. The Node.js API accesses an external fake API build

## Run React project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Run Node.js backend

Before we run the backend, we need to update the fake API endpoind. To update this value, do the following steps:

#### In the backend, go to employees.js file: `nutcache-challenge-viniciusvieira/backend/routes/employees.js`
#### Go to [https://crudcrud.com/] and click on 'Check Endpoint Information'.
#### On the dashboard, copy the Endpoint Information value.
#### Find the `ENDPOINT` variable and replace its value by pasting the endpoint value you just copied.

Now you are ready to run the backend!

### `cd backend`
### `npm start`
